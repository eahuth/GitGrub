Oven-Baked Tri-Tip Roast (originally from https://kalejunkie.com/wprm_print/easy-oven-baked-tri-tip-roast)

Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 Pounds tri-tip

Directions:
1. To make this recipe, start by allowing the tri-tip to come to room temperature.
3. Season the tri-tip to your liking, then let it rest while you preheat the oven to 350 F.
4. While the oven is preheating, heat a pan, on the stove, over high heat and add in a few tablespoons of olive oil (or avocado oil). Once the pan is hot, place the tri-tip inside the pan and allow it to cook for about 4 minutes on each side.
5. If you're using a meat thermometer, place it inside of the tri-tip.
6. Then, remove the pan from the stove and place it into the oven. I like to cook my tri-tip so it's medium rare, which means it reaches an internal temperature of 135 F. If you aren't using a thermometer, this will take approximately 15-17 minutes.
7. Once the tri-tip is done, remove it from the oven and allow it to rest for a few minutes before slicing it, serving as desired, and enjoy! Store any leftovers in an airtight container, in the fridge, for up to three days.

Notes: 
- The original recipe has a marinade; this is mostly for cooking instructions. 
- It shouldn't really matter how large the tri-tip is; you're looking to get it to an internal temperature of 135. 
- We find the pre-seasoned tri-tip from Costco is pretty good (although salty), so we'd like to try more variations of seasonings.
