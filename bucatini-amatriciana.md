From Paul Petronella, Paulie's, Houston

Ingredients:
- 1/2 lb bucatini (Petronella recommends DeCecco)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4 ounces smoky bacon, uncooked, chopped medium
- 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) red wine vinegar
- 12-16 whole cherry tomoatoes
- Pinch chili flakes
- 3 ounces (about one cup) grated Pecorino Romano cheese

Instructions:
- Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Petronella likes his water to "taste like the ocean."
- In a large saut√© pan, heat olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add bacon and cook until slightly crispy, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant and softened, being careful not to burn, one to two minutes.
- Deglaze pan with vinegar, scraping up any browned bits sticking to the bottom.
- Lower heat to medium-low, add tomatoes and chili flakes, and cover pan. Cook until the tomatoes soften and "burst," releasing their juices into the pan.
- While sauce is cooking, drop bucatini into the pot and cook according to package instructions. We recommend testing the pasta at one minute less than indicated on package. Drain pasta, reserving 1/4 cup pasta cooking water.
- Uncover sauce, add reserved pasta water, raise heat to medium and cook uncovered until sauce thickens slightly. Swirl or stir to combine and emulsify. The sauce is thickened properly when the back of a spoon dragged along the bottom of the pan leaves a slight trail.
- Add pasta to pan, toss to combine, making sure to coat each strand. Divide into two warmed bowls and serve immediately, topped with Pecorino Romano cheese.

Notes: 
- You want good bacon here, with a pronounced and almost aggressive smokiness.
- For a saucier result, add more tomatoes.
