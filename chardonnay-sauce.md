Chardonnay Sauce (from https://britacooks.com/chardonnay-chicken/)

Ingredients:
- 1⁄2 bottle of Chardonnay
- 1.5 cups chicken stock I used Kettle & Fire
- 1 shallot minced
- 3 cloves garlic minced
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tbsp butter
- Juice from 1⁄4 lemon
- 1 tsp dijon mustard
- 1⁄3 cup heavy cream
- Chives or italian parsley to garnish

Directions:
1. In a skillet over medium heat, add olive oil and 1 tbsp of butter until melted. 
2. Reduce the heat and add in the finely minced shallot and garlic. Sauté for about 2 minutes until softened. Deglaze with half a bottle of Chardonnay and increase heat back up to medium so it comes to a simmer. Stirring occasionally, let that reduce by half (this should take about 5-7 minutes but could take longer depending on your pan/stove! Turn up the heat slightly and stir continuously to help if it's not reducing quickly enough).
3. Add in the chicken stock and let this reduce for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Once all of the liquid has reduced by half and has thickened (continue to cook until you reach this point) then you can slightly reduce the heat. Add in a squeeze of lemon juice, the dijon, and 1 tbsp of butter. Stir well to incorporate.
4. Take off the heat and finish the sauce with some heavy cream or creme fraiche. 

Notes:
- Original recipe was with chicken (pouring over the top). However, you can use it in many other ways, like adding to macaroni with spinach and mushrooms for a delicious side.
