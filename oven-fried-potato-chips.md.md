Oven-Fried Potato Chips (from https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/oven_fried_potato_chips/)

Ingredients
- 4 russet (or 6 Yukon Gold) potatoes, peeled and sliced diagonally 1/8-inch thick
- 4 tablespoons (1/4 cup) butter, melted (can use extra virgin olive oil instead)
- Kosher salt, to taste

Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 500째F (260째C). Grease 2 large baking sheets with non-stick cooking spray. Make sure you are using sturdy baking sheets, or a flat roasting pan that can take high heat. A standard cookie sheet may warp.
2. Soak the potato slices, then pat dry:
3. Place the potato slices in a bowl of ice water for 5 minutes to remove some of the excess starch. Drain, then pat the slices dry with paper towels.
4. Put the slices on a baking sheet, then brush with butter:
5. Arrange the sliced potatoes in a single layer on the baking sheets. Use a pastry brush to brush the potato slices with melted butter.
6. Put in the oven and lower the temp to 450째F (230째C). Bake until the edges are golden brown, about 12 to 15 minutes, depending on your particular oven.
7. Sprinkle with salt and serve:
8. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with salt to serve.

Notes: 
- A mandoline is the best way to get the evenly thin slices of potatoes that work well for this recipe.
- If you use multiple sheets the bottom layer will likely need more time. Be patient and don't burn them!
- We use olive oil instead of butter.
