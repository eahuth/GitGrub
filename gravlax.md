Gravlax (from https://sweden.se/culture/food/gravlax)

Ingredients:

- 750 g (26 oz) fresh salmon fillet with skin on
- 4 tbsp (2 oz) sugar
- 4 tbsp (2 oz) sea salt
- 100 g (3.5 oz) chopped dill
- 2 tsp crushed white pepper

Sauce:

- 2 tbsp mild Swedish mustard
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1½ tbsp red wine vinegar
- Salt and white pepper to taste
- 200 ml (1 cup) oil (not olive oil)
- Chopped dill

Instructions:

1. To minimize the risk connected with eating raw fish, you might want to freeze the salmon before preparing it.
When defrosted, scale the salmon and remove the small bones that might remain, but leave the skin on.
Make a few cuts in the skin so the marinade will penetrate from below.
2. Mix salt, sugar and pepper and sprinkle it beneath and on top of the salmon fillet along with plenty of dill.
Place a weighted cutting board on top of the salmon fillet and let it marinate at room temperature for 2–4 hours.
Then refrigerate for 24−48 hours, turning the salmon fillet a few times.
3. To serve, unwrap the fish and brush off the marinade.
Cut into thin slices without getting too close to the skin, so the dark salmon is included.

For the sauce:

1. Mix the mustard, sugar and vinegar and season with salt and freshly ground pepper.
Stir vigorously, while pouring on the oil in a steady, thin stream.
When the sauce has attained a mayonnaise-like consistency, stir in the chopped dill.
Serve alongside the dill-cured salmon.

Notes:

- We haven't actually made this using the raw recipe, but rather just cure the salmon using the suggested recipe and bake in the oven to the accepted internal temperature for salmon.
