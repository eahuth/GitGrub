### Meatballs

Adapted from Marcella Hazan's recipe

Ingredients:

- 1/3 cup milk
- 1 slice bread (brioche works well)
- 1 pound lean beef
- 1 tablespoon chopped yellow onion
- 1 tablespoon chopped parsley
- 1 egg
- 3 tablespoons freshly granted Parmesan cheese
- vegetable oil
- salt
- freshly ground pepper
- bread crumbs
- 1 cup canned Italian tomatoes

For the beef: 
1. Mash the bread with a fork and blend it uniformly into the milk.
2. In a mixing bowl put the chopped meat, onion, parsley, egg, grated parmesan, 1 tablespoon of oil, the bread and milk mush, 1 teaspoon of salt, and the pepper. Mix everything thoroughly but gently by hand.
3. Gently, without squeezing, shape the mixture into small round balls about 1 inch in diameter. Roll the meatballs lightly in the bread crumbs.
4. Choose a skillet, large enough to hold all the meatballs in a single layer, with a cover. Pour in oil until it is 1/4 inch deep. Turn on the heat to medium high, and when the oil is quite hot slip in the meatballs. (Sliding them in with a broad spatula is a good way of doing it). Brown the meatballs on allsides, turning them carefully so that they don't break up or stick to the pan.
5. When well browned turn off the heat, tip the pan slightly, and remove as much of the fat that floats to the surfaces as you can with a spoon. TUrn on the heat to medium, add the chopped tomatoes with their juice and 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and turn the meatballs over once or twice with care, so that they don't break up. Cover the skillet and cook until the tomato has thickened into sauce, about 25 minutes. While cooking, turn the meatballs over from time to time, and taste for salt.
